# Walkthrough - Black Box Verification

I have performed a comprehensive black box test of the updated features to ensure everything works seamlessly from a user's perspective.

## Test Results

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Services Accordion** | ✅ Passed | Cards expand/collapse correctly. Opening one closes others. |
| **Quote Calculator** | ✅ Passed | Form submits successfully. "Get Another Estimate" button works. |
| **Footer Socials** | ✅ Passed | Clean design, no black backgrounds. Links work. |
| **Floating Button** | ✅ Passed | Expands to show WhatsApp, Call, Email. Custom WhatsApp logo visible. |
